# Loop Model Scoring
This repository contains an implementation of a method for scoring the loop model and treatment decisions, as proposed by Damon Bayer in [this documentation](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14AJ9u2oGJiiJU1cWVDf_rC_WdJc0oOj1uIkXutOovQU/edit#).

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Virtual environment tool


## Setup

1. Create a virtual environment by running the following command:
`python -m venv loop-scoring`

2. Activate the virtual environment by running the following command:
`source loop-scoring/bin/activate`

3. Install the required packages by running the following command:
`pip install -r requirements.txt`


## Usage

The documentation is under construction.

### Run example script
Run `<EXAMPLE_SCRIPT>.py` in terminal in the root directory to recreate the loop scoring plot examples used in the documentation.

#### example_mock_data.py
An example script that recreates the examples in the documentation of the penalty function.

#### example_one_forecast.py
An example script that calculates and plots one forecast trajectory for a given date, and calculates the penalty for the trajectory.

#### example_between_dates.py
An example script that calculates and plots the penalties for the forecasts between two given dates.

#### example_therapy_settings.py
An example script that plots the penalty given various therapy settings in 3D. It is assumed that the therapy settings are not varying throughout the day.

Example plot of results: 
1) Carb ratios as well as a linear combination between basal rate and ISF (negatively proportionate.

2) Using the carb ratio that provides the lowest average penalty in the last plot, we plot the penalties for different basal rates and insulin sensitivity factors.

### Credentials for Tidepool API

Create a file named `credentials.json` in the root directory. Copy and paste the following information and adjust the information with your credentials:

`{
	"tidepool_api": {
		"email": "YOUR_TIDEPOOL_USERNAME",
		"password": "YOUR_TIDEPOOL_PASSWORD"
	} 
}`

### Therapy settings

The calculations of forecasts are based on the therapy settins defined in `therapy_settings.json`.


# Important Notes
- Predictions are based solemnly on past data (assuming no knowledge about future inputs)
- For now, the default meal model is the linear one in pyloopkit, and there is no simple way of using parabolic (I plan to change it and add a PR)
