## Setup and Installation

To setup and install this platform, there are two options depending on whether you are a regular user or a developer:
1) **Install using pip (regular users):** If you want to access the command line interface (CLI) without reading or modifying the code, choose this option.


2) **Install using the cloned repository (developers):** This is the choice if you want to use the repository and have the code visible, and to potentially edit the code.

Choose which one is relevant for you, and follow the instructions below.


----
### Regular users: Install using pip
Open your terminal and go to an empty folder in your command line.  Note that all the data storage, trained models and results will be stored in this folder.

Creating a virtual environment is optional, but recommended. Create a virtual environment with the command `python3 -m venv glupredkit_venv`, and activate it with `source glupredkit_venv/bin/activate`.

To set up the CLI, simply run the following command:

```
pip install glupredkit
```


----
### Developers: Install using the cloned repository

First, clone the repository and make sure you are located in the root of the directory in your command line.
To set up the repository with all requirements, simply run the following command:

```
./install.sh
```

Make sure that the virtual environment `bgp-evaluation` is activated before you proceed. If not, call `source bgp-evaluation/bin/activate`.



## Usage of Command Line Interface

The command-line tool is designed to streamline the end-to-end process of data handling, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and configuration for blood glucose prediction. The following is a guide to using this script.

### Getting started
1) First, follow the instructions above in "Setup and Installation". 
2) Then, navigate to a desired folder in your command line. 
This is the folder where the datasets, models and results will be stored.
3) Set up the necessary directories for the GluPredKit CLI by running the following command:
   * For regular users: `glupredkit setup_directories`
   * For developers: `python3 -m glupredkit.cli setup_directories`

You should now have the following file structure in your desired folder:
   ```
   data/
   │
   ├── raw/
   │
   ├── processed/
   │
   ├── trained_models/
   │
   ├── figures/
   │
   └── reports/
   ```

Now, you're ready to use the Command Line Interface (CLI) for processing and predicting blood glucose levels.

Note that the prefix for all the commands will be either `glupredkit` for regular users, or `python -m glupredkit.cli` for developers.
In the examples below we will use `glupredkit`.


### Parsing Data
**Description**: Parse data from a chosen source and store it as CSV in `data/raw` using the selected parser. If you have an existing dataset, you can store it in `data/raw`, skip this step and go directly to preprocessing.

```
glupredkit parse --parser [tidepool|nightscout|apple_health] USERNAME PASSWORD [--file-name FILE_NAME] [--start-date START_DATE] [--end-date END_DATE]
```
- `--parser`: Choose a parser between `tidepool`, `nightscout` or `apple_health`.
- `username`: Your username for the data source.
- `password`: Your password for the data source.
- `--start-date` (Optional): Start date for data retrieval, default is two weeks ago. Format "dd-mm-yyyy".
- `--end-date` (Optional): End date for data retrieval, default is now. Format "dd-mm-yyyy".

#### Example

```
glupredkit parse --parser tidepool johndoe@example.com mypassword --start-date 01-09-2023 --end-date 30-09-2023
```

---

### Preprocessing Data
**Description**: Preprocess data from an input CSV file and store the training and test data into separate CSV files.

```
glupredkit preprocess INPUT_FILE_NAME [--preprocessor [scikit_learn|tf_keras]] [--prediction-horizon PREDICTION_HORIZON] [--num-lagged-features NUM_LAGGED_FEATURES] [--test-size TEST_SIZE] [--num_features NUM_FEATURES] [--cat_features CAT_FEATURES]
```
- `--preprocessor`: Choose between scikit_learn and tf_keras for preprocessing.
- `input-file-name`: Name of the input CSV file containing the data. Note that this file needs to be located in `data/raw`.
- `--prediction-horizon` (Optional): Prediction into the future given in time in minutes.
- `--num-lagged-features` (Optional): The number of samples to use as time-lagged features. CGM values are sampled in 5-minute intervals, so 12 samples equals one hour.
- `--test-size` (Optional): The fraction in float to how much of the data shall be used as test data.
- `--num-features` (Optional): List of numerical features, separated by comma. Note that the feature names must be identical to column names in the input file.
- `--cat-features` (Optional): List of categorical features, separated by comma. Note that the feature names must be identical to column names in the input file.

#### Example

```
glupredkit preprocess tidepool_16-09-2023_to_30-09-2023.csv --num-features CGM,insulin --cat-features hour
```


---

### Train a Model
**Description**: Train a model using the specified training data.
```
glupredkit train_model --model MODEL_NAME INPUT_FILE_NAME [--prediction-horizon PREDICTION_HORIZON]
```
- `--model`: Name of the model file (without .py) to be trained. The file name must exist in `src/models`.
- `input-file-name`: Name of the CSV file containing training data. The file name must exist in `data/processed`.
- `--prediction-horizon` (Optional): The prediction horizon for the target value in minutes.

#### Example
```
glupredkit train_model --model ridge train-data_scikit_learn_ph-60_lag-12.csv
```
---

### Evaluate Models
**Description**: Evaluate one or more trained models using the specified test data, compute metrics and generate plots. The results will be 
stored in `results/reports` for evaluation metrics and in `results/figures` for plots.

```
glupredkit evaluate_model --model-files MODEL_FILE_NAMES [--metrics METRICS] [--plots PLOTS] TEST_FILE_NAME [--prediction-horizon PREDICTION_HORIZON]
```
- `--model-files`: List of trained model filenames from `data/trained_models` (without .pkl), separated by comma.
- `--metrics` (Optional): List of metrics from `src/metrics` to be computed, separated by comma.
- `--plots` (Optional): List of plots from `src/plots` to be generated, separated by comma. 
- `test-file-name`: Name of the CSV file containing test data.

#### Example
```
glupredkit evaluate_model test-data_scikit_learn_ph-60_lag-12.csv --model-files ridge_ph-60,arx_ph-60,svr_linear_ph-60 --metrics rmse
```

That's it! You can now run the desired command with the mentioned arguments. Always refer back to this guide for the correct usage.









## Contributing with code

In this section we will explain how you can contribute with enhancing the implementation of parsers, preprocessors, models, evaluation metrics and plots.

### Contributing With New Components

Regardless of the component type you're contributing, follow these general steps:

1. Navigate to the corresponding directory in `src/`.
2. Create a new Python file for your component.
3. Implement your component class, inheriting from the appropriate base class.
4. Add necessary tests and update the documentation.

Here are specifics for various component types:

#### Parsers
Refers to the fetching of data from data sources (for example Nighscout, Tidepool or Apple Health), and to process the data into the same table. 
   - Directory: `src/parsers`
   - Base Class: `BaseParser`

#### Preprocessors
Refers to the preprocessing of the raw datasets from the parsing-stage. This includes imputation, feature addition, removing NaN values, splitting data etc.
   - Directory: `src/preprocessors`
   - Base Class: `BasePreprocessor`

#### Machine Learning Prediction Models
Refers to using preprocessed data to train a blood glucose prediction model.
   - Directory: `src/models`
   - Base Class: `BaseModel`

#### Evaluation Metrics
Refers to different 'scores' to describing the accuracy of the predictions of a blood glucose prediction model.    - Directory: `src/metrics`
   - Base Class: `BaseMetric`

#### Evaluation Plots
Different types of plots that can illustrate blood glucose predictions together with actual measured values.
   - Directory: `src/plots`
   - Base Class: `BasePlot`

Remember to adhere to our coding and documentation standards when contributing!


### Testing
To run the tests, write `python tests/test_all.py` in the terminal.


## Disclaimers and limitations
* Datetimes that are fetched from Tidepool API are received converted to timezone offset +00:00. There is no way to get information about the original timezone offset from this data source.
* Bolus doses that are fetched from Tidepool API does not include the end date of the dose delivery.
* Metrics assumes mg/dL for the input.
* Note that the difference between how basal rates are registered. Bolus doses are however consistent across. Hopefully it is negligable.
